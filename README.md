Run with medium data
edit report to fix bugs
make graphs good (fix the bar chart with data for every team for each season (consider showing top 50, or find a way to make it use dots and not bars) 
                  Make the axis labels bigger than the tick labels, consider changing font, title size, font color, y axis label orientation (horizotal), etc.
