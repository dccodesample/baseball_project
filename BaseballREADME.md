Box Score: the format that the results of baseball games are reported in. The top line
of the box score belongs to the away team, and the bottom line belongs to the home team. The
numbered portion of the data frame represents how many runs each team scored in their portion
of the inning. The 'R', 'H', and 'E' sections represent the number of runs the team scored,
the number of hits they got, and the number of errors they made. An example of a box score
can be found here, https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI201903280.shtml.
